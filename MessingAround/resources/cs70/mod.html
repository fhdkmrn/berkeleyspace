      <p id="problems">1. What is the invrese of 7 mod 48 (if it exists). </p>

    <div class="sol"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">7. Notice that 7 *7 = 49 = 1 mod 48, which is the requirement for the inverse. </span></pre></div>

    <p id="problems">2. Let p, q be distinct prime numbers. Prove that p<sup>q-1</sup> + q<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod pq)</p> 
    <div class="sol2"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">Since p,q are unequal prime numbers, we know that gcd(p,q) = 1. So, we can apply fermat's little theorem both ways. 

First, p<sup>q-1</sup> = 1 (mod q) by Fermat's little theorem, and q<sup>p-1</sup> = 0 (mod q), so their sums are equal to 1 (mod q). 

Moreover, by a similar argument as above but by switching the roles of p and q, we get that p<sup>q-1</sup> + q<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod p).

Now, we get that p<sup>q-1</sup> + q<sup>p-1</sup> - 1 is divisible by both p and q and, since p and q are relatively prime, we know that the above equation is divisble by pq. Now, we have that p<sup>q-1</sup> + q<sup>p-1</sup> - 1 = 0 (mod pq), and adding 1 to both sides of the equation gets us what we are trying to prove.  </span></pre></div>

      <p id="problems">3. Disprove one of Euler's conjectures. Show that there is some positive integer <var>n</var> such that 133<sup>5</sup> + 110<sup>5</sup> + 84<sup>5</sup> + 27<sup>5</sup> = n<sup>5</sup>. </p>

    <div class="sol3"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">We're looking for some n, so it will be extremely useful to find some remainders n has after certain divisions. 

To begin, let's look at the equation mod 5, keeping in mind Fermat's Little Theorem which claims that n<sup>5</sup> is n (mod 5). Taking each value mod 5, we get 3 + 0 + 4 + 7 = n (mod 5), so 4 = n (mod 5). We now that n has a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. 

Continuing, let's look at the equation mod 3. We get 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = n<sup>5</sup> (mod 3), so 0 = n (mod 3). We now know that n is perfectly divisible by 3. 

By inspection, it n must be either 144 or 174. From there, we see that 175 is too large to satisfy the original equation, so we conclude that n = 144.</span></pre></div>
