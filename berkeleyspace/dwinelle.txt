 	 	 	Note: "The Gods in Augustan Poetry" - Although the ancient philosophers had long dismissed the poets' depictions of the gods as inaccurate at best, or even blasphemous, Vergil and Ovid, the two major epic poets of the Augustan period, gave the gods an even more central role in their epics than Homer had done. The gods of the Aeneid are both vivid as characters and endowed with cosmic significance, while the gods of the Metamorphoses have all the flaws of humanity, combined with the power to turn their flaws into frightening threats to mankind.

 	 	 	Note: This course is intended for students who have taken both Greek 100 and Greek 101. It provides an introduction to Greek drama through Euripidean tragedy. The play studied in Fall 2015 will be Euripides' Hippolytus. In addition to close attention to the translation of the Greek text, the course will offer a general introduction to Greek tragedy and tragic language and meters as well as consideration of literary interpretations of the play. The Phaedra-plays of Seneca and Racine will be read in English. Additional texts illustrating contemporary Athenian society will be introduced as time permits.

 	 	 	Note: "Aristophanes' Acharnians" - In this class we will translate Aristophanes' Acharnians and analyze this play from different angles: linguistic, dramaturgical, aesthetic, political, and cultural-historical. Our meetings will aim to translate in class most of each week's readings. Besides translating the text, we will also discuss secondary readings, which will help students develop ideas for their term paper. Students will be asked to give two short presentations: one on a specific linguistic aspect of the text (a word or a particular grammatical construction) and one on their paper topic.

 	 	 	Note: "Race, War, Culture" - This seminar investigates regimes of racial relationality that have utilized and contested the concept of war. The course advances historical and theoretical approaches to what appear in the contemporary moment as new forms of racialization. It focuses on three overlapping lines of inquiry: Fanon's entanglement of anti-blackness, colonialism, and decolonization; Foucault's investigations of sovereignty and biopower; and Hall's Gramscian theorizations of race. Students will engage social, cultural, and political theory alongside critical culture work, and will produce a final seminar paper.

Focusing on short prose, drama, and film, we will study texts that narrate the formation and transformation of family in its many valences: an emotional union, a politically defined institution, an economic unit, and a gender regime. We will consider how family stories from a range of cultural periods (romanticism, realism, modernism, the postwar era, and the present) communicate with critical theories of family from Engels and Freud onward.

This course will focus on the theory and practice of propaganda during the 12 years of the Third Reich. The course is divided into two main parts, which address (1) the historical developments in Nazi Germany until the outbreak of the War, 1933-1939; and (2) the Second World War and the destruction of European Jewry, 1939-1945.

We will focus on exemplary texts and films from Germany, but include comparisons with minority experiences in other countries.

 	 	 	Note: "Poverty and Social Policy" - This course is designed to provide a comparative overview of how poverty is addressed in the United States and in rich European member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In this class we will examine values, assumptions, definitions and theories that shape the understanding and measurement of poverty. We will consider explanations for the persistence of poverty and review relevant research on proposed causal factors. We will look at how theory and research have guided the design of anti-poverty policy and will analyze policies for their impact on poverty alleviation.

 	 	 	Note: "Latin American Development" - Course examines Latin American development from the 19th century to the present. We will evaluate the explanations offered for the region's classification as "underdeveloped" or "developing" and then use a case study/country approach to critique those explanations. Major themes include dependency theory and commodity chain analysis, industrial and agrarian developments, labor militancy and indigenous politics. A main purpose of this course is to provide context for students seeking to understand contemporary issues and challenges confronting the region and its citizens. No prior knowledge of the region is required.

 	 	 	Note: "Commodities, Trade and Global Labor Regimes" - From silver to cocaine, sugar and tobacco, to cotton, oil and electronics, the nature of work has been shaped by expanding global demand for products whose origins - whether in the soil or the factory - remain mysterious. This course will explore the worlds of production and consumption and ask how global demand for specific commodities has shaped local, national and global politics. We will examine legal and illegal products, the cultural context in which products are made and acquire value, and the tangled relationship between production, ownership, labor discipline and human rights.

 	 	 	Note: Trailing Berkeley's long tradition of understanding the "other," this course pursues the search for one of the civilizations that deeply marked and inspired Western civilization. The Jewish tradition, one of the cornerstones of Europe and the New World, belongs to a group of ancient cultures originated in the Fertile Crescent, which throughout time was crystallized in evolving oral and written references, around which were condensed and preserved fundamental moments of the relation between God and humanity. This course will examine thoughts of Jewish authors who dedicated themselves to the study of their tradition in a particularly creative mode.
