      <p id="main"> Important! These are all exam-level problems. Do not attempt these problems without a solid foundation in the subject and use them for exam practice. </p>

      <p id="problems">1. You would liek to send a message of length n over a channel. You know that, at most, k packets may be dropped along the way and of the packets not dropped, at most j may be corrupted. How many packets do we need to send in order to guarentee a successful decoding? Why?</p>

    <div class="sol"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">We must send n + k + 2j packets. Let's say the worst thing happens and all k possible packets are dropped and all j packets are corrupted. We ned to send k extra packets in order to protect from the erasure errors, and then 2j more packets to protect from general errors. </span></pre></div>

    <p id="problems">2. How many different polynomials of degree <var>d</var> over GF(p) are there if we know k values, where k <= d?</p> 
    <div class="sol2"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">p<sup>d+1-k</sup>. We need d+1 points to make the polynomial, and if we know 0 points, then every point can be anything in the span of p. As soon as we start finding more points, the amount of non-fixed points becomes less and less, until k = d+1, where we are left with one polynomial.</span></pre></div>    
    <a class="solution-toggle-p2 btn btn-default">Toggle Solution</a>

      <p id="problems">3. Secret sharing is a crucial application of Polynomials. We have 4 TAs and 14 readers, and we want to share a secret among them such that either 2 or more TAs, at least 1 TA and at least 2 readers, or at least 4 readers can reconstruct the secret. Describe such a scheme. </p>

    <div class="sol3"> <pre><span class="solution-prompt">A TA is essentially 2 readers, so if we make a polynomial of degree 3 such that P(0) is the secret, each reader gets one point while each TA gets 2 points. This will be a perfect scheme. </span></pre></div>
